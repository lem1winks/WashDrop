  <!-- Unreal will use these values to sign when packaging app in Distribution mode.
       See http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#releasemode for information 
       on creating the files needed to sign for distribution (ie, using the keytool utility)
       
       keyalias: This is the name of the key that you specified with the -alias parameter to keytool.
       keystore: This is the file that keytool outputs, specified with the -keystore parameter.
                 The file can be stored in this directory, or you may give it a path to another location
       keystorepassword: This is the password that you specified FOR THE KEYSTORE NOT THE KEY, when running 
                         keytool (either with -storepass or by typing it in).
       keypassword: This is the password for the key that you may have specified with keytool, if it's 
                    different from the keystore password. Delete this item, or leave as "_sameaskeystore_" to 
                    make it use the keystorepassword.
